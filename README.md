### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer who likes to dabble in many things, with a particular interest in Javascript/Node, music and music visualization, creative coding, bots, and Raspberry Pi/Arduino.

### ðŸ”­ Check out some of my projects
- GradientBot [ [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@GradientBot) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GradientBot_) ] - A Node.js bot running on a Raspberry Pi that generates a new gradient wallpaper every hour
- Stripey [ [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@Stripey) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StripeyBot) ] - Another Node.js bot running on a Raspberry Pi that generates a new striped wallpaper every hour

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Playdate game development
### âš¡ Fun fact: I once won a year of free video game rentals at my local Blockbuster Video by winning a Donkey Kong Country tournament
