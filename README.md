### Hello! 👋

I'm a web developer who likes to dabble in many things, with a particular interest in Javascript/Node, music and music visualization, creative coding, bots, home automation, homelabbing, and IoT.

### 🔭 Check out some of my projects
*  [GradientBot](https://shuriken.masto.host/@GradientBot) - A Node.js bot running on a mini PC that generates a new gradient wallpaper every hour
*  [Stripey](https://shuriken.masto.host/@Stripey) - Another Node.js bot running on a mini PC that generates a new striped wallpaper every hour
* [My Neocities page](https://fiveelementninja.neocities.org/) - A static site built with NextJS and deployed to Neocities. Currently just displays the last song I listened to on my Plex server.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
* Work: TypeScript
* Fun: The joys of homelabbing and self-hosting

### ⚡ Fun fact
I once won a year of free video game rentals at my local Blockbuster Video by winning a Donkey Kong Country tournament
